## Bug bounty program

As part of our commitment to being the safest way for users to access decentralized services:

- {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} is extending its top-tier million-dollar HackerOne bug bounty program to cover the {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} network, the {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} bridge contracts, and {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} infrastructure.
- {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} will collaborate closely with OP Labs to enhance the security guarantees of Bedrock and expedite the implementation of decentralized fault-proofs on the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/).
- {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK}'s bug bounty program will operate in parallel with Optimism's existing Immunefi Bedrock bounty program to support the open-source [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/) OP Stack framework.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

Potential vulnerabilities can be reported through the [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/WMC) platform.

Using HackerOne allows us to consolidate all reports into a single, streamlined system, ensuring efficient response times and effective resolutions. Every submission is reviewed 24/7 by our dedicated {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} engineering team, who possess deep expertise in the relevant domains, guaranteeing a thorough and accurate assessment.

For more details on how to report vulnerabilities and to learn more about our HackerOne bug bounty program, please refer to our [security program policies](https://hackerone.com/WMC?view_policy=true).
