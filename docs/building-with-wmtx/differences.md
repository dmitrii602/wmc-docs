# Differences between Ethereum and {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK}

{process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} is built on the [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/explainer/) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which is designed from the ground up to be as close to Ethereum as possible. Because of this, there are very few differences when it comes to building on {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} and Ethereum.

However, there are still some minor discrepancies between the behavior of {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} and Ethereum that you should be aware of when building apps on top of {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK}.

These minor differences include:

- [Opcodes](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#opcode-differences)
- [Blocks](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#blocks)
- [Network specifications](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#network-specifications)
- [Transaction costs](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#transaction-costs)
