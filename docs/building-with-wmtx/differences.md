# Key distinctions between Ethereum and {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK}

{process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} is developed on the [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/explainer/) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which was specifically designed to closely mirror Ethereum. As a result, building on {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} is very similar to building on Ethereum, with minimal differences.

That said, there are still a few subtle distinctions in how {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK} operates compared to Ethereum, and it's important to be mindful of these when developing applications on {process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK}.


These minor differences include:

- [Opcodes](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#opcode-differences)
- [Blocks](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#blocks)
- [Network specifications](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#network-specifications)
- [Transaction costs](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#transaction-costs)
