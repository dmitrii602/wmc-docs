### Ethereum L3

WMTx is built as an Ethereum Layer 3 solution, offering enhanced scalability, security, and flexibility specifically designed for the needs of the World Mobile ecosystem. This L3 architecture allows for more efficient and cost-effective transactions, tailored to handle the unique demands of WMTx's decentralized network. By operating on Layer 3, WMTx benefits from the foundational security of Ethereum while enabling faster and more scalable operations that are essential for global adoption. This structure supports the seamless deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications, optimized for the World Mobile network, and ensures that users and assets can move fluidly across different layers of the blockchain, providing a robust and adaptable environment for innovation.


### Advanced features with minimal costs

Unlock the power of the EVM environment without the heavy price tag. WMTx leverages advanced Ethereum capabilities like Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) to elevate user experience and simplify development. With ERC-4337, you can combine multiple transactions into one, streamline wallet recovery without the need for a seed phrase, and allow users to cover gas fees using their preferred tokens.

### Powered by Open source

WMTx is architected on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), developed in close collaboration with Optimism. As an active Core Dev team, we are committed to maintaining and enhancing the OP Stack to ensure it remains a public resource accessible to everyone. This collaborative approach guarantees a secure, scalable, and transparent foundation, fostering continuous innovation within the decentralized ecosystem. Security is a core focus, with WMTx building on Ethereum's robust security features and adding additional protections tailored to safeguard user assets and data, particularly in the context of financial inclusion and global connectivity.


### Expanding with WMTx

WMTx provides a straightforward way for decentralized applications to leverage World Mobile's products and capabilities. Seamless integration with World Mobile, easy access to fiat onramps, and connection to a growing network of users within the World Mobile ecosystem.
